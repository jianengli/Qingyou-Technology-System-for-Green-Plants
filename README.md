## Background
With the development of society, stress often makes students, white-collar workers and other groups feel deeply exhausted. At this time, it is time to relax people's minds and relieve stress. Green plants can effectively help people reduce stress from the visual aspect. Look at the green plants to help relax your mind. Compared with plants, animals can interact more with people, but animals pose a lot of problems and troubles. We make bold assumptions and give plants the emotion to communicate with people and activate the plants. Then we meet the needs of people's communication. At the same time, we can build a social function that can build a bridge between couples, families and even strangers. The effect of healing the soul is finally achieved.

 Based on plant breeding, plant monitors, network connection technology, and desktop application technology, the four core points form a set of physical + connection + network system products. This product is a software and hardware integrated product, suitable for all ages.
 
 The product monitors the physiological state of the plant through the plant monitor of the corresponding plant, and then sends the data to the desktop application. The application transforms the physiological state of the plant into actions and moods that mimic the image, and the user can interact with the plant according to its performance. Communicate and take care of plants.
 
 The product also has a social function, establishing a personal garden section (similar to a multi-person chat room), enabling users to communicate with their parents, close friends, couples, etc. on the growth and change of plants, ensuring the privacy of customers, and establishing the owner's exclusive secrets. garden.
 
 There is also the World Garden section (web crawler), where users can enter the URL of a gardening website that they usually like to log in, and users can quickly check the breeding experience of other users.
